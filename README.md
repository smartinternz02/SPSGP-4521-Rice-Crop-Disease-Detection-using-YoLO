Rice Crop Disease Detection using YoLO

In this i am using yolov3 model.

YoLO (you only look once), an algorithm that is used for object detection in real time. It predicts classes and bounding boxes for the testing images in one run of the algorithm.

YOLO-based Convolutional Neural Network family of models for object detection and the most recent variation called YOLOv3.

YoLOv3 has a deeper architecture of feature extractor called Darknet-53. 

A 53-layer trained on Imagenet and for the task of detection 53 more layers has been stacked onto it, which gives us a 106 layer fully convolutional underlying architecture for yolov3.
